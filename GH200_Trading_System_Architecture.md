# GH200 Trading System Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the GH200 Trading System architecture, detailing the data flow, processing steps, and key components.

## System Overview

The GH200 Trading System is a high-performance trading system designed for the NVIDIA GH200 platform. It uses a hybrid HFT (High-Frequency Trading) architecture, combining machine learning models with traditional trading strategies. The system ingests market data, generates trading signals, manages risk, and executes trades with extremely low latency.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Ingestion
- **Polygon.io API Integration**: 
  - REST API for full market snapshot of all tickers
  - WebSocket for real-time trade and quote updates
- **Data Processing**:
  - JSON parsing and normalization
  - Direct GPU memory mapping for efficient processing

### 2. Feature Extraction
- **CUDA-Accelerated Processing**:
  - Parallelized calculation of 20+ technical indicators per stock
  - Market microstructure features
  - Real-time feature normalization

### 3. Two-Phase ML Inference

### 4. Risk Management
- **Pre-Trade Validation**:
  - Position sizing using Kelly criterion
  - Correlation checks for portfolio diversification
  - Risk exposure limitations
  - Drawdown management

### 5. Execution Engine and Order Management
- **Execution Engine**:
  - Processes validated signals from risk management
  - Creates order objects with appropriate parameters
  - Handles both simple and bracket orders

- **Alpaca Broker Client**:
  - Communicates with the Alpaca API to submit, modify, and cancel orders.
  - Uses bracket orders to set trades with entry, take-profit, and stop-loss levels in a single order submission.
  - Currently configured for paper trading, but can be configured for live trading by providing Alpaca API keys.

### 6. Exit Optimization

    - 128 hidden units per layer
    - Bidirectional architecture
    - Attention mechanism for focusing on relevant price movements
    - Reinforcement learning approach (Double DQN)
  - Takes the following inputs:
    - Current position data: entry price, time in position, unrealized P&L
    - Market context: volatility, trading volume, trend strength
    - Technical indicators at multiple timeframes
